+1 There are 3 different Levels/Scenes,

+1 theres a cool beginning screen and ending win screen that you get to go through by obtaining score
+1 Each Scene has different background music, theres a coin, enemy and shooting sound effect.
+1 Each tile has specific materials set, the enemy and coins have unique materials, my use of lighting allowed for a day, sunset and night level
+1 I have a cross hair, a particle shoots out straight when you shoot, my lights and music create a different atmosphere in each level, the choppyness from the last level at night adds to the tense feelings, funny begin/end, I've got chibi enemies.
